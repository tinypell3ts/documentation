# Define

Define transforms the raw signals from the Monitor phase into clear tasks with guidelines, deadlines, and rewards. AI plays a crucial role by analyzing the data from the Monitor phase and proposing structured objectives, 
such as writing a whitepaper or fixing a bug. This stage outlines the exact criteria for success, ensuring that each task is unambiguous and anyone can understand what's required. 
At this point, blockchain-based contracts hold any staked tokens or fees in escrow, guaranteeing that the agreed-upon reward is locked in. Clarity is king here, 
because a well-defined task paves the way for straightforward validation later.
