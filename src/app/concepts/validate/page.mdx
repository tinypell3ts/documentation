# Validate

Validate confirms that the delivered work meets the agreed-upon standards. AI or trusted community members—often with tokens staked—review the submission, check its quality, 
and rule on whether the task is truly complete. If validators cheat, they risk losing their stake, which deters dishonest approvals. This step maintains integrity: participants 
know that half-baked efforts won't pass, and valuable contributions will be recognised. With the blockchain storing these verdicts, the outcome is tamper-proof. 
In essence, Validate ensures fairness by locking good work into the ledger and rejecting anything that doesn't measure up.
