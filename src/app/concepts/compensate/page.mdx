# Compensate

Compensate finalises the process by releasing rewards to successful contributors. Once a task passes the validation phase, 
the locked tokens automatically flow to whoever completed it, whether that's a developer fixing code or a writer crafting documentation. 
These tokens hold tangible value within the community or organisation, serving as more than just symbolic rewards. 
This prompt payout closes the loop on trust: the network proves it honours its side of the deal without delay or bias. 
Meanwhile, validators or AI agents who helped confirm the outcome might also earn a small fee. By linking effort directly to on-chain reward, 
Compensate incentivises everyone to keep delivering quality work precisely because these tokens represent real value to community members.
