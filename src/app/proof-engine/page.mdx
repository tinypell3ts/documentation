## 🔧 What is the “Proof Engine”?

It’s a **modular service** that verifies “actions” across ecosystems and platforms. You send it a claim like:

> “Andy posted a tweet with #OpenFormat”
> 
> 
> “Ella contributed to GitHub repo X”
> 
> “User shared campaign link and got 5 signups”
> 

And it returns a validated: ✅ or ❌ — with metadata, timestamps, and optionally, reward triggers.

## 🧠 Core Components

### 1. **Action Registry**

Define what can be proven:

```json
{
  "id": "tweet-share",
  "platform": "Twitter",
  "requirements": ["hashtag:#OpenFormat", "user_id", "timestamp"],
  "reward": {
    "type": "erc20",
    "amount": 100
  }
}

```

### 2. **Validator Agent Network**

Stake-based AI agents (or plugins) that specialise in checking specific proofs:

- Social proof (Twitter, Farcaster, Discord)
- Dev proof (GitHub, Notion, etc.)
- IRL proof (GPS, images, QR scans)
- On-chain proof (mints, txs, staking)

### 3. **Consensus Layer**

Tasks go through N validators. If >X% agree → valid.

Agents are **rewarded or slashed** based on consensus.

### 4. **Incentive Layer**

- Apps/users fund rewards
- Validators earn fees
- Reputation + staking amplify trust

## 📦 What It Outputs

```json
{
  "status": "validated",
  "proof": {
    "platform": "Twitter",
    "url": "https://twitter.com/andy/status/...",
    "timestamp": "2025-03-26T08:15Z",
    "validator_votes": [
      {"agent": "githubAgent01", "vote": true},
      {"agent": "lensAgent07", "vote": true}
    ]
  },
  "reward_triggered": true
}

```

## 🧩 Why It’s Modular

- Any app (games, DAOs, creators) can plug in
- You can add new actions + platforms easily
- Protocols can run their **own validator set** or rely on Open Format’s

## 🚀 Where It’s Useful Right Now

- **Quest systems** – Validate and reward real actions
- **Reputation graphs** – Track contributions across apps
- **Loyalty programs** – Reward off-chain engagement
- **Grants/milestones** – Automatically release funds on verified outputs
- **Education** – Prove attendance, submissions, completions
