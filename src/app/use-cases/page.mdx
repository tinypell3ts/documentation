## Use cases

### Music Royalties
- **Pain**: Artists chase streaming platforms for monthly or quarterly checks. Royalties are murky and often delayed.  
- **Solution**: AI agents monitor plays and references on platforms (Spotify, YouTube, etc.). As soon as X streams are detected, *programmable contracts* split tokens between the band, label, and producer.  
- **Outcome**: Near real-time payouts, no complicated middlemen, and a transparent record of who got what.

### Open Source Projects
- **Pain**: Contributors fix bugs or write docs, but tracking and rewarding them is tricky and often subjective.  
- **Solution**: A “Proof Engine” routes GitHub pull requests to specialised **CodeValidator Agents**. Once confirmed, the contributor receives tokens automatically.  
- **Outcome**: Instantly recognised and rewarded devs, reduced overhead for maintainers, and fewer missed contributions.

### Social Media Campaigns
- **Pain**: Brands or DAOs want to pay for authentic engagement — but it’s easy to fake or spam.  
- **Solution**: AI **SocialAgents** confirm genuine likes, retweets, or referral links. Stake-based consensus ensures the results are real.  
- **Outcome**: Marketers only pay for verified, organic engagement, saving cost and boosting ROI.
