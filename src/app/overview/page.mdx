Today, people all over the world are creating, contributing, and collaborating online — but the systems we use to recognise and reward those efforts haven’t kept up. Payments are slow, unclear, and controlled by middlemen. Communities and organisations need better ways to understand what’s being done, confirm it actually happened, and fairly compensate the people doing the work. We’re building the tools to make that possible — simple, open, and designed for the digital world.

### 1. Programmable Money

People shouldn’t have to wait days to get paid or rely on others to split money fairly. Programmable money solves this by allowing money to move automatically when certain conditions are met — like a built-in rule that says, “Pay this person when the task is complete.”

Under the hood, this is powered by smart contracts — self-executing code deployed on a blockchain. These contracts hold funds and release them based on predefined logic. For example, a contract can hold a bounty and only release it when an AI validator confirms the work is complete. You can build in logic for recurring payments, time-locked disbursements, milestone-based payouts, or dynamic splits across multiple wallets.

This removes the need for traditional finance infrastructure and allows anyone, anywhere, to get paid without intermediaries. It’s faster, cheaper, and globally accessible.

### 2. Coordination

Groups often struggle to know who’s doing what, what’s needed, or how to fairly reward people. Coordination tools provide a shared way for communities and teams to list jobs, match them to the right people, and keep track of what’s getting done.

In our approach, coordination isn’t just about structured task boards — it starts with listening. We use a combination of humans and AI agents to observe and understand what is required. For example, our system can listen across social channels to identify the evolving needs, questions, and opportunities coming from the community. This blend of soft and hard data helps generate a clearer picture of what matters and what actions will have the most impact.

Technically, this layer sits between intent and execution. Participants can browse available tasks, signal interest, and get matched automatically based on their history, credentials, or wallet activity. The coordination layer can also enforce rules like minimum qualifications, contributor limits, or dependencies between tasks.

It gives structure to decentralised work by replacing traditional org charts and project managers with transparent systems that anyone can plug into.

### 3. Validation

If you’re going to pay someone for a task, you need to know the work actually happened. That’s where validation comes in. We use a network of smart digital helpers — AI agents — that check and confirm if something really took place, like sharing a post, attending an event, or completing a piece of work.

These AI agents act as validators. Each one specialises in a specific type of action — whether that’s reading blockchain state, analysing content, or confirming attendance using external APIs. They act as a decentralised oracle network. Each validator submits a claim, and a quorum or confidence threshold determines if the action is approved.

This is critical for off-chain and multi-platform actions. It brings trust and automation together, ensuring that compensation only happens when work is genuinely completed.

### 4. Compensation

People are more likely to contribute when they know they’ll be fairly rewarded. Compensation in digital economies means automatic rewards — which could be money, recognition, or special access — given out once a task is complete and confirmed.

Compensation mechanisms include ERC20 token transfers, NFT issuance, access keys, or badges. These can be delivered through smart contracts once validation passes. Tokenomics can be tuned based on role, rarity of the task, or contribution history.

This layer ties the loop together — turning validated effort into value. It ensures contributors are motivated, appreciated, and continuously engaged. Compensation becomes more than just payment — it’s a signal of trust, ownership, and status within the ecosystem.

Together, these four parts form a simple but powerful loop:

> Know what needs doing → Do the work → Confirm it’s done → Get compensated
> 

This is the foundation for a new kind of digital economy — one that’s fair, fast, and built for how people actually work online today.
