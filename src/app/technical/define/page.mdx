## JSON Standard for Task Definition

Below is an example of a standardized JSON format that can be used to define tasks within the Open Format ecosystem:

```json
{
  "taskId": "task-123456",
  "title": "Fix API Authentication Bug",
  "description": "There's an issue with JWT token validation in the authentication middleware that needs to be fixed.",
  "criteria": [
    "All API endpoints must validate JWT tokens correctly",
    "Expired tokens should return 401 Unauthorized",
    "Malformed tokens should return 400 Bad Request",
    "Implementation must include unit tests with >90% coverage"
  ],
  "deadline": "2023-12-15T23:59:59Z",
  "reward": {
    "amount": "0.5",
    "token": "ETH",
    "distribution": "on-completion"
  },
  "skills": ["Solidity", "JavaScript", "Security"],
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "status": "open",
  "escrow": {
    "contractAddress": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
    "lockedAmount": "0.5",
    "releaseCondition": "validator-approval"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "priority": "high",
    "source": "github-issue-142",
    "tags": ["bug-fix", "security", "authentication"]
  }
}
```

This JSON structure provides a comprehensive definition of a task, including clear success criteria, reward information, and escrow details to ensure transparent and fair task allocation and completion.
